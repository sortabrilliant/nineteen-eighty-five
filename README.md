With the release of WordPress 5.0 we saw it as a new beginning for WordPress.

One trend that has really bothered me is how everything is obsessed with clean and minimal themes. This has caused most WordPress themes to look the same. 

I don’t want clean & minimal. I want something different, so I made it. We made Nineteen Eighty Five a child theme of Twenty Nineteen as I wanted to show people that it’s easy to turn something boring into something fun.

The Nintendo Entertainment system came out in 1985 in the US which is why we decided to call the theme Nineteen Eighty Five.

The styling of this theme comes from the NES.CSS project.
